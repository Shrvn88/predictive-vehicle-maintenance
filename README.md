EDA Report:

Dataset characteristics

    Multivariate run-to-failure engine telemetry

    Variable lifetimes per unit

    Smooth degradation trajectories

Key preprocessing decisions

    Removed constant sensors

    Selected sensors with RUL correlation

    RUL computed per unit using final cycle

Observed degradation

    Certain sensors show monotonic drift

    Variance increases near failure

    RUL decreases approximately linearly
